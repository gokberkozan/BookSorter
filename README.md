## Book Sorter
### Explanation
Create a class called "Book." Take over the "compareTo" method and inherit this class from the Comparable interface. Write the code to sort the book by name from A to Z using this way. This class can be used to create five items, which should be stored in a Set type structure. Next, arrange the books by page count using a data structure of type Set for the second time.
